## What is the Tech Consulting Track?
The TAMID at Brandeis Tech Consulting Track exists to provide students with an
opportunity to get hands-on software engineering experience with organizations
in the Israeli ecosystem.

### How will it work?
***The TAMID at Brandeis Tech Consulting Track will be operating completely
remotely in Fall
2020***.

We will be working with our client to write code into their existing
database. We will be giving our client weekly updates of our progress, and will
be directly integrated into their project management workflow.

#### Workflow
We will be working in 2-week sprints in coordination with our Project Manager
and Product Manager. We will assign tasks via a
[Jira Board](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/what-is-a-board-938845235.html#:~:text=A%20board%20displays%20issues%20from,of%20boards%20in%20Jira%20Software%3A&text=Kanban%20board%20%E2%80%94%20for%20teams%20that,constraining%20their%20work%2Din%2Dprogress)
based off of interest and technical knowledge.

Students will [program in pairs ](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/)
in order to ensure quality code, share knowledge, and bond.

After developing a feature, a code review will then be completed by the VP of
Technical Consulting or Tech Team Lead.

#### Fun bonding!
Due to the smaller nature of this track, we will likely do fun activities such
as:
* Participate in online hackathons
* Game nights
* Movie nights

> None of this is mandatory, we just want to make the track fun!


## What is the time commitment?
The TAMID at Brandeis Tech track will meet **twice a week** starting **August
15th, 2020**.

> Education sessions will be 1.5 to 2 hours.

There will be a 3-week education period where students will learn about pivotal
technology terms, version control, an overview of the Israeli tech world.

### Hours per week
*The expected time spent working* ***outside*** *the Tech Track is 5 hours per
week.*

> We will meet twice a week synchronously, likely for an hour per meeting.
These meetings will happen over Zoom at a time that  works best for all members
of the track.
Asynchronous communication will happen over Slack throughout the week.
These meetings will be used for demos, technical discussions, bonding, and
sprint reviews.*

## Our Client

### Company Introduction
We will be working with [Vibo](vibo.io), a B2B2C DJ technology company.
Vibo's clients are DJs, who use their event management software to plan events.
Vibo offers three different mediums to help DJs organize their events:

<details>
  <summary><b>1. The Mobile App</b></summary>
  The Mobile App is used by the DJ's clients. The DJ can create an event,
  and invite their clients to request songs via Vibo's app. Their clients can
  share the link wih friends, and they can all like/dislike songs, along with
  making songs as a 'must play' or as a 'do not play'.

  DJs can organize the songs into different sections,

<br />

<details>
  <summary><b>2. The Web App</b></summary>
  The Web App is similar to the mobile app, but it is exclusively used by the
  DJs. It allows for the DJs to organize their events with more options.
</details>

<br />

<details>
  <summary><b>3. The Scanner</b></summary>
  The Scanner is a desktop application that allows DJs to scan their music
  library to find out what songs they do and do not have that were requested by
  the client.
</details>


> You can find
[videos about Vibo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUY5lXtzSWY&t=364s)
on Youtube.

### What we are building
We will be building ViboTrends, a data analytics tool that uses
Vibo's event data to identify song trends. We will be building an
API (Node, Typescript) to query
their database (MongoDB, ElasticSearch). We will write unit tests for this API
(Jest). We will then display this data in their web application using React.

#### Tools
* Front-End: React, Typescript
* Back-End: Node, Express, Typescript
* Databases: MongoDB, ElasticSearch
* Testing: Jest
* Other: AWS
